Hi Professor,

This is Niannian Li. We talked  a couple of times before.

For the project to do translation between Datalog and SQL, I finished the project today and tested. 
So sorry that it took such a long time, as i just got free time recently, and I started from scratch to code.
So the work is original.

If you are still interested, I sincerely hope you can set up a time at your convenience.
We can then have a short discussion, hopefully, I can go deeper later.

Thanks so much.
