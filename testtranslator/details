1sqlStatements:
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE
INSERT INTO
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW … AS SELECT … (actually SELECT statements, just save records as a view)

e.g.:
SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE A(a string);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE B(b string);
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE C(a string,b string);
INSERT INTO A VALUES ('a1');
INSERT INTO A VALUES ('a2');
INSERT INTO A VALUES ('a3');
INSERT INTO B VALUES ('b1');
INSERT INTO B VALUES ('b2');
INSERT INTO B VALUES ('a1');
INSERT INTO C VALUES ('a1','a1');
INSERT INTO C VALUES ('a1','b2');
INSERT INTO C VALUES ('a2','b2');
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW PROJECTION_RULE AS SELECT * FROM A;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW SELECTION_RULE AS SELECT a FROM A WHERE a='a2';
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW INNER_JOIN_RULE AS SELECT a FROM A INNER JOIN B on A.a=B.b;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW LEFT_JOIN_RULE AS SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B on A.a=B.b;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW RIGHT_JOIN_RULE AS SELECT * FROM A RIGHT JOIN B on A.a=B.b;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW FULL_JOIN_RULE AS SELECT * FROM A FULL JOIN B on A.a=B.b;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW UNION_RULE AS SELECT * FROM A UNION SELECT * FROM B;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW DIFFERENCE_RULE AS SELECT * FROM A EXCEPT SELECT * FROM B;

1datalogPrograms:
facts
rules: identified by sign :-
•	most rules are Positive
•	Negation is applied to one rule: Stratification: Netation on IDB
•	no recursive rule
•	Semi–Positive: can be seen as positive, not tested this time
•	all rules are safe, manually evaluated, more code will be added to evaluate automatically

e.g.:
Datalog
A('a1'). 
A('a2'). 
A('a3'). 
B('b1'). 
B('b2'). 
B('a1'). 
C('a1','a1'). 
C('a1','b2'). 
C('a2','b2'). 
PROJECTION_RULE(a) :- A(a).
SELECTION_RULE(a) :- A(a), a='a2'.
INNER_JOIN_RULE(a) :- ij(A(a), B(b), a=b).
LEFT_JOIN_RULE(a,b) :- lj(A(a), B(b), a=b).
RIGHT_JOIN_RULE(a,b) :- rj(A(a), B(b), a=b).
FULL_JOIN_RULE(a,b) :- fj(A(a), B(b), a=b).
UNIONRULE_RULE(a,b) :- A(a); B(b).
DIFFERENCE_RULE(a) :- A(a), ¬B(b).

all code explained
Go to https://github.com/niannianli/TestTranslator
From bottom to up:
•	File named references.pdf, i found this resource online which includes almost all details about Datalog/SQL/Prolog, used as the main reference for this project
•	Two files named details/details.docx, whichever you can open: all details about this project
•	File named commandLineTestSession.rtf: one command line session to test the code
•	File named 1translator.jar: executable file: use below commands to run the file:
o	cd /…DIRECTORY WHRERE YOU SAVE THIS FILE…/
o	java –jar 1translator.jar /…DIRECTORY WHERE YOU SAVE INPUT FILE…/INPUT FILE NAME
•	Inside folder inputOutputFiles: files named 1sqlStatements/1datalogPrograms: can be input files; 1sqlStatementsOutput/2datalogProgramsOutput are output files generated after translation:
o	cat /…DIRECTORY WHERE YOU SAVE OUTPUT FILE…/OUTPUT FILE NAME
o	you can see the output contents after translation
o	if input is Datalog, output will be SQL
o	if input is SQL, output will be Datalog
•	Inside folder ExtraTestFiles: files will be used for further test
•	Go to folder src/com/nian/:
•	Folder translator:
o	File TranslatorStart: read input file, run translation function, generate output file
o	File Translator: 2 functions: traslate Datalog to SQL; or translate SQL to Datalog; run the function being called by TranslatorStart
•	Folder sqltodatalog:
o	File StatementType: categorize SQL statements to 3 types for now: CREATE, INSERT, VIEW; VIEW meaning CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW …AS SELECT…, which includes several SQL statements
o	File SQLToDatalogTranslator: this class is called by Translator, to call build functions to parse input SQL and genereate output Datalog
o	File SQLStatement: every line of string (from input) ends with a ; is parsed as a SQLStatement; then we can decide what type of SQL statement it is: CREATE/INSERT/VIEW
o	File SaveStringsUtilOne: when we are parsing SQL statements, save all table names, variables for each table, values(records) for each table, which can be used for later parsing input/building output
o	File DatalogIDBBuilder: parse SQL VIEW statements, genereate Datalog rules
o	File DatalogEDBWithValuesBuilder: parse SQL INSERT statements, generate EDBs/facts with values; a table can have many records, each record is an array of values
o	File DatalogEDBBuilder: parse SQL CREATE TABLE statements, just save table name and variables; do not generate anyting; one table only has one list of variables; 
o	File DatalogBuilder: has 3 functions, each will be called by SQLToDatalogTranslator to build 2 types of Datalog programs; each function is calling one type of builder to build Datalog program
•	Folder datalogtosql:
o	File StratifiedDatalogProgram: used to stratify datalog program to ensure rule safety, not implemented yet
o	File SQLViewSelectBuilder: used to build CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW … AS SELECT …, SQL statements
o	File SQLCreateInsertBuilder: used to build CREATE TABLE/INSERT INTO, SQL statements, they must be built together: as tables must be created, before we can insert values; also variables’ types can only be parsed from insert statements
o	File SQLBuilder: 2 functions called by DatalogToSQLTranslator to build SQL statements, each function is calling one builder to build SQL statements
o	File SaveStringsUtilTwo: evaluate(to be done later) and parse input Datalog program, save all info for further use to build SQL statements
o	File ProgramType: decide Datalog to be POSITIVE, SEMI-POSITIVE, OR STRATIFIABLE…not used for now
o	File ProgramEvaluatorParser: we parse only, evaluate to be done; called by DatalogToSQLTranslator
o	File DatalogToSQLTranslator: called by Translator, to translate Datalog to SQL, not stratify or do recursive datalog program for now
o	File DatalogProgram: a datalog program should come with an input, not checking POSITIVE, SEMI_POSITIVE, STRATIFIABLE for now, assume all input are safe rules

to be improved
•	Many iterations in the code: running time/space not efficient
•	7 types of sql statements for now: CREATE, INSERT, SELECT * FROM WHERE, SELECT … FROM WHERE, JOIN, UNION, EXCEPT 
•	SQL: not checked yet: 
o	Pk
o	fk
o	NOT NULL
o	UNIQUE
o	REFERENCES
o	DETERMINED BY 
o	GROUP BY
o	Variable type: INTEGER, VARCHAR…; for now, all string
o	Cache
o	Cartesion
•	Corresponding to 6 types of EDB clause/IDB rules for now: facts with values, selection rule, projection rule, join rule, union rule, difference rule
•	Assume all input datalog rules are safe, a datalog rule is safe if every variable appears in some positive relational atom, more code can be added to evaluate/ensure datalog rule safety later, as got too many bugs in this part, removed the code for now
•	Rule finite-infinite not checked
•	Stratification: not done yet
•	A Java framework can be used to parse the datalog rules/sql statements, for now, I pass the input token by token, which is tedious; can try to use the framework later, the below syntax can be parsed easily:
o	Atoms. An atom has the form a(t1, ..., tn), where a is a predicate (relation) symbol, and ti (1 ≤ i ≤ n) are terms. If i is 0, then the atom is simply written as a. 
o	Restricted atoms. A restricted atom has the form -A, where A is an atom built with no built-in. 
o	Conditions. A condition is a Boolean expression containing conjunctions (,/2), 
o	disjunctions (;/2), built-in comparison operators, constants and variables. 
•	No recursive rule yet:
o	e.g.:
WITH RECURSIVE all super(Major,Minor) AS (SELECT PART, SUBPART
FROM assembly
UNION
SELECT assb.PART, all.Minor FROM assembly assb, all super all WHERE assb.SUBPART = all.Major )
SELECT *
WHERE Minor=’topTube’

CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW allSubparts(Major,Minor) AS SELECT PART SUBPART
FROM assembly
UNION
SELECT all.Major assb.SUBPART FROM allSubparts all, assembly assb WHERE all.Minor=assb.PART
